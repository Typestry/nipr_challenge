# Pages

This directory is where you can create and organize the individual pages or views of your application. Each subdirectory within "Pages" can represent a different section or feature of your application, making it easier to structure and manage your project. Whether you're building a web app, mobile app, or any software with multiple views, this directory is the place to define and organize your application's user interfaces and functionality.
