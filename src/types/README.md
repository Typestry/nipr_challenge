# Types

This directory serves as a central location for defining custom TypeScript types, interfaces, and type aliases used throughout your project. Properly defining types is essential for enhancing code clarity, catching potential errors during development, and improving the overall maintainability of your codebase. In this directory, you can organize and categorize your type definitions to make them easily accessible and reusable across different parts of your application.
